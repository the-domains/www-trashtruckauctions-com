**Why Choose Us?**

There are a lot of auction companies out there. They sell a lot of different things - equipment such as backhoes, trackhoes, dozers, articulated trucks and the like. They auction parts, pieces, gadgets and widgets. And they have thousands upon thousands of items for sale at one time.   
If you deal with equipment and want to find it, they probably have it.  
But is that how you want your refuse equipment sold? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f5ba4c2f-9322-4084-a843-25071e6b9dfc.png)

## Do you want your equipment to be part of the crowd, or firmly in the spotlight? 

Don't you want your asset _marketed directly to the right people_?

Don't you want an auction company that specializes in selling the type of equipment you want to sell? One who knows the players, knows the buyers and sellers, the end users, one who knows the market?

That's where we come in. You see, all we sell is refuse equipment. That's it. Looking for a used dozer, or a set of forks for a farm tractor, or perhaps you'd like to find a pile of used surveyor's stakes? That's not us. Looking for refuse equipment - rear loader, front loaders, dump trucks, side loaders, and the like? That's us. And no one does it better.

**Our Process**

Each of our truck auctions starts long before our 30 day timer starts on an individual lot. By marketing your equipment for thirty days before our auction ever goes live, this first stage becomes about _pre-selling _your equipment. It's about generating interest, creating hype, getting people talking about your trucks. Marketing.

Information is key to our auction process. We'll start off by gathering the build sheets for your trucks, verifying hours and mileage, and finally, by getting some great pictures of your trucks, all cleaned up and ready to go to their new home.

After the auction, we'll put together an easy to understand bid tabulation report, email it to you, and you're ready to award units to the highest bidder. You'll pay us no fees, of course, because those are paid by the winning buyer. 

At Southern Procurement Services, we've run bids to purchase equipment for our municipal and private sector clients for the better part of a decade. Using our Reverse Auction process, we've saved our clients time, thousands of dollars per purchase, and streamlined their purchasing process. It's a unique and interesting process, and the closest thing to an art form that procurement will ever attain, and if you haven't used it before, you should call us.
